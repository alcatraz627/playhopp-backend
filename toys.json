By constructing seven different models with the motorized gyroscope unit, young engineers can experiment with and learn about the science of gyroscopic devices and the indispensable role they play in our lives. The models include the gyroscopic robot, a balancing personal vehicle, a gyro horizon (or artificial horizon), a gyrocompass, a balancing game, a tightrope walker, and a flight simulator. At the core of these models is a unique motor-driven gyroscope. A gyroscope is a rapidly spinning wheel mounted in such as way that its axle can move in any direction. Because of the laws of physics, the gyroscope reacts to external forces differently than a non-spinning wheel would: it resists forces in certain directions. This behavior allows it to be used for all sorts of applications related to balance, rotation, and orientation. Fun, hands-on experiments with the motorized gyroscope unit make these physical laws tangible and easier to comprehend. The word \u201cgyroscope\u201d comes from the Greek words gyro, for \u201ccircle\u201d or \u201crotation,\u201d and skopeein, meaning \u201cto see.\u201d The name was originally coined by a scientist who built the device in an experiment to see Earth\u2019s rotation. Although gyroscopes are used in very sophisticated devices, essentially they are simple mechanical instruments. A child\u2019s spinning toy top is a simple example of a gyroscope.", "skills": "Concepts of Physics", "playIdeas": "The 24-page, full-colour manual answers questions and more, while providing step-by-step illustrated instructions on how to assemble the models.", "brand": 39, "primaryImage": "", "minAge": 8, "maxAge": 12, "piecesNumber": "109", "points": 7, "category": 14, "created_at": "2019-09-18T07:00:39.474Z"}}, {"model": "toys.toy", "pk": 1447, "fields": {"title": "Solar Car", "description": "Construct a solar electric car and four additional models.
